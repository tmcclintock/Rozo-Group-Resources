Here I demonstrate how to use the code [CLASS](http://class-code.net/), which is a Boltzmann code written in C++ with a fairly easy-to-use Python interface. This is most useful for our group for computing the matter power spectrum, which is then used for correlation functions and other calculations. The papers for CLASS are linked [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2932), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2933), [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2934) and [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2935). On the CLASS website there are a few other links to papers that use CLASS that should sometimes be cited.
