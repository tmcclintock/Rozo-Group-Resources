# Group Resources
This repository contains helpful tutorials on things that will help people get caught up to speed in Edaurdo Rozo's research group.

## Contents
Each directory contains the following:
* ```C_integrands``` - how to make your Python integrals go faster by writing the integrands in C
* ```Debugging``` - how to interpret error messages from C or Python
* ```Fitting Models``` - solutions to many of the problems in David Hogg's "Fitting a Model to Data" paper
* ```GP_examples``` - some examples of how Gaussian Processes work
* ```Making Figures``` - instructions on how to make presentable plots for group meetings and papers
* ```Numerical Exercises``` - some problems in computational cosmology that are good to have done yourself at least once
* ```Using Class``` - examples of how to use the Boltzmann code CLASS. Boltzmann codes are necessary to do cosmology that involves large scale structure

## To be added
You can contribute as well. Here are some topics that could be expanded on.
* ```Splines and interpolation``` - a breakdown of how to interpolate data. Sometimes a linear interpolator is good, other times a spline is good. Explain what these technical terms are and show the difference between these choices
* ```Basic parallelism``` - some programs are super slow but can be run on many cores or CPUs at the same time. Show examples of using Pthon's ```multiprocess``` package, using OpenMP in C, and also OpenMPI in C
* ```Cosmology homeworks``` - a collection of exercises that everyone in the group should do at least once. E.g. correlation function definition, differences between halo-halo halo-matter and matter-matter correlation functions, transforming between power spectrum and correlation functions, basic gravitational lensing, pair counting, understanding what a mass function is, opening a data catalog, etc.
* ```Terminology cheat sheet``` - What's the difference between DES and DESC? What about SLAC and slack? What *is* large scale structure, weak vs strong lensing, correlation functions, etc.?
